―Valkorion[src]
Prior to the Great Galactic War, the Emperor of the Sith Empire, Vitiate, started building up the Eternal Empire on Zakuul under the name Valkorion. He planned to use the Eternal Fleet to reshape the galaxy, the Sith Empire actually being used as a "side project", with the Eternal Empire being his actual plan. During his time on Zakuul, he married Senya, a Knight of Zakuul and raised twin sons, Thexan and Arcann. After Vitiate took all life on the planet Ziost, he retreated into Wild Space to the planet  Here, he sent his sons to war against both the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire, eventually pushing both factions to the brink of extintion. During one such encounter on a Sith planet, an attack didn't go as planned, which led to Arcann losing his arm and half his face. In the throne room of the Eternal Empire, the twins presented their spoils of war. Valkorion took note, then turned his back on his sons, which enraged Arcann. Powered by the Dark side, Arcann leaped at his father, but got pulled back by his brother. After a swift duel, Thexan was killed. Valkorion then approached his now only son, and asked him to come with him.
Arrival of the Outlander
After the defeat of the Revanites, a joint Imperial and Republic fleet, led by Darth Marr, entered Wild Space while investigating leads potentially linked to Vitiate. Valkorion quickly noticed, and sent out the entire Eternal Fleet to engage them. After a quick battle, Marr, and an individual would be later known as the Outlander, were captured. Arcann brought them in front of the Eternal Throne, where Marr recognized Valkorion as the former Vitiate. Valkorian released Marr from his restraints and offered him mercy if Marr would only kneel, which Marr flatly refused. He only managed to kill a few guards before Valkorion hit him with a blast of Force lightning, killing him. Valkorian made the same offer to the Outlander, promising that with their obedience he would share his power with them. If the Outlander accepts, Valkorion begins the process of sharing his power, but Arcann seemingly kills him. If the Outlander refuses, Arcann is seemingly about to execute the Outlander, but instead cuts them lose from their bonds so they can both attack Valkorion. Valkorion easily defeated his son, but was seemingly killed by the Outlander with their weapon which Arcann had returned. Either way, Arcann survived the confrontation and took the Eternal Throne for himself, ordering the Outlander, who is unconscious, to be imprisoned; frozen in Carbonite for assassinating the Emperor.

While suspended in carbonite, the Outlander was met by Valkorion, telling him that he had finally shed his physical body, and reached true immortality as a Force spirit. Valkorion also revealed that Zakuul would be the new superpower in the galaxy, with an army of force users who did not follow only the light or the darkside. He, however, recognized that this was a power that Arcann misused. The Outlander was told that he was dying, and was woken up by Lana Beniko. </span>

      <p class="spoiler2">
       <span>Centuries before our story begins, Tenebrae becomes Vitiate, becomes Emperor of the Sith, and leads the survivors of the Sith into exile to Dromund Kaas. He rules directly for many years.

As years go by, he becomes more and more dissatisfied with the Sith Empire he’s created. He finds himself increasingly distanced from the Sith philosophy that first brought him to power and sees it as a dead end (as he expresses several times in KOTFE/KOTET) and, with the immense power at his disposal, begins striking out in search of something better. This is when his “long periods of silence” begin.


He discovers Zakuul, which is in a comparatively primitive state (by Star Wars tech standards, anyway) and dominates Valkorion, as he describes in KOTET Chapter 2. He learns the ancient legends of the gods, of the Eternal Fleet, etc, and investigates them with his considerabe resources. By this point, he has certainly already started the collection of rare and powerful technologies and artifacts that we find in the Arcanum, his vault on Nathema, etc. He (or perhaps agents working for him, such as the Servants) finds the Eternal Fleet disabled in deep space and is able to seize control of it (based on how ARIES talks, we can be fairly sure that neither Valkorion nor his agents ever visited Iokath itself).

The technology of the Fleet helps him raise Zakuul still further. In his Valkorion persona, he constructs a more stable society that he finds more interesting, one that has more potential to let him explore different experiences for centuries to come (his quote above and his many claims of Zakuul being the bestest thing ever). So now, he just needs to ensure that he’ll live forever, and that nothing else will threaten his new creation. The ritual (the one the Jedi Knight ultimately stops) will serve both purposes, so he sets that plan in motion, kicking off the Great Galactic War between the Sith Empire and the Republic. (I don’t think it’s much of a stretch to believe that he could avoid destroying Zakuul, which is waaaay out at the outer edge of the galaxy, when using a ritual that he himself is creating over many, many years, but that should’ve been something we at least let Jedi Knight players ask.)

Then, Vitiate abruptly stops the war, proposes a treaty claiming seemingly-random planets, and starts the Cold War. An obscure step in his plan to complete the ritual? Makes sense, though if we look at how old Valkorion’s children appear to be, they’d be getting born right around this time… coincidence?

Senya tells us that Valkorion started becoming colder and more distant as the children grew up, so we can surmise that he’s splitting his attention again during this period. The assault of Sel-Makor and the final attack by the Jedi Knight take a lot out of him. His ritual is thwarted, and he is too weak to dominate another body or risk Valkorion until he’s reinvigorated by Revan’s plot in SoR – otherwise, he would’ve surely done so. He could’ve used the Fleet to cause the necessary deaths, but he wasn’t ready to reveal its power to the galaxy yet – more on that shortly.

The events of Shadow of Revan give him the boost he needs to become active again – and he does so in spectacular fashion on Ziost, all while playing up his “evil destroyer of everything” Vitiate persona to the max. He’s greatly reinvigorated, he’s dealt a significant blow to the Sith Empire (which had been rapidly increasing in strength after Rise of the Hutt Cartel), and he’s baited the player and their allies in one fell swoop. All of which leads inexorably to the confrontation in the throne room in the beginning of KOTFE – but why?

For this, we just have to look at the last person who ever stood up to Vitiate at anywhere near the level that the player’s character did on Ziost: Revan. When Revan took a crack at him, Vitiate locked him up for centuries, picking and prodding at his mind the entire time. So we know that Tenebrae/Vitiate/Valkorion doesn’t destroy people who are a legitimate threat to him; he’s fascinated by them. He entraps them, studies them, manipulates them, and corrupts them. (He did it to Vaylin, too! And Dramath!)

So, to review: Valkorion has been revitalized; he’s got a tremendously powerful fleet; he’s got the Republic in the weakest state it’s been since the treaty of Coruscant and the Sith Empire not far behind; he’s discovered a new threat that can actually take a shot at him; and he’s got a wife who’s left him and children that he finds deeply disappointing (see pretty much any time he ever deigns to speak to them) in line to take over his supposedly perfect society. Time to solve all of his problems at once!

He spurs his son’s bloodlust and ambition by setting him and the fleet loose on the galaxy (now that they’re definitely in no state to resist the fleet’s power or endanger Zakuul). He lures his new enemy into a trap and captures them. He arranges his own “death”, whether by the player’s hand or Arcann’s, and invades the player’s mind. Arcann and Vaylin do exactly what he expects, which is to generally muck up the galaxy and establish themselves as tyrants in need of overthrowing. And then he arranges and guides the player in doing just that, all the while laying the groundwork for dominating their mind at the moment of their victory and commanding a newly-reshaped galaxy as a heroic liberator – an all-new experience to try out. Too bad it didn’t work out for him
