     		<span>Revan—renowned as the Revanchist, reviled as Revan the Butcher, worshiped as the Revan, dreaded as the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Revan, and praised as the Prodigal Knight—was a human male who played pivotal roles as both Jedi and Sith in the Mandalorian Wars, Jedi Civil War, and Great Galactic War.

 Believed to have been born around 3994 BBY in the Outer Rim Territories, the child later known as Revan was found by the Jedi Order and apprenticed to the Jedi Master Kreia. The Padawan had an insatiable hunger for knowledge and soon became the Jedi's most promising pupil. Alongside his friend Malak, he became a Jedi Knight and a vocal and charismatic critic of the Order's inactivity in the ongoing Mandalorian Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. In defiance of the Jedi Council, the Knight took upon the name Revan and started the Revanchist movement to combat the Mandalorians as the Republic Military's Supreme Commander. Revan and his forces gradually pushed back the Mandalorians, saving countless worlds at the price of devastating moral compromises and the embrace of dark side practices. On Malachor V, Revan defeated the Mandalorian leader Mandalore the Ultimate in single-combat and ordered the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator superweapon, destroying both armies and the planet but winning the war in the process.

 Revan and Malak, now hailed as the greatest of heroes, vanished into the Unknown Regions to investigate a mysterious Sith influence behind the war. They discovered a hidden Sith Empire and fell under the thrall of the Sith Emperor Vitiate. Vitiate directed the newly anointed Darth Revan and Darth Malak to find the mystical Star Forge to escalate plans of a galactic invasion, but the pair broke free from his mind control and used the Star Forge for themselves—creating their own Sith Empire and a fleet of warships. Intent on unifying the galaxy to destroy the lurking Sith menace, they returned to the galaxy as conquerors and battled the Jedi and the Republic in the resultant Jedi Civil War. Revan almost succeeded, but Malak usurped the throne and fired aboard his flagship during a Jedi ambush led by Bastila Shan. Revan nearly died, but Bastila healed him and took him before the surviving Jedi for judgment.

 The Jedi Council used their powers to wipe Revan's mind and soon retrained him as a Jedi. Alongside Bastila and newfound companions, Revan was tasked to relocate the Star Forge—the heart of Darth Malak's Sith Empire. Across his journey, Revan picked up more allies and fell in love with Bastila, but they were eventually intercepted by Malak's flagship. Malak revealed to Revan his true identity as the former Dark Lord, then captured and corrupted Bastila to the dark side. Revan escaped and, in a last stand, led the remaining Republic fleet against the Star Forge, redeemed Bastila back to the light side, and killed Malak in battle, destroying the Sith Empire he created. Revan married Bastila and sank into obscurity until visions from his past led him to rediscover Vitiate's Sith Empire. Alongside his former protégé Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile, and the Sith Lord Scourge, Revan attempted to assassinate the Emperor. However, Scourge betrayed the pair, killing Meetra and helping Vitiate imprison Revan in stasis.

 Revan waged telepathic war against the Emperor for three-hundred years, influencing him into stalling his Sith invasion at terrible cost to his own psyche. Revan eventually escaped captivity and took control of the Foundry space station to construct an army of extermination droids against the Empire, but he was foiled and killed by an Imperial strike team. However, with his mind splintered across centuries of torture, his darker half rejected death and resolved to destroy Vitiate. The Emperor's body had recently been destroyed in battle, but his spirit lingered, so Revan planned to resurrect him to a physical form to permanently destroy him. A coalition of Imperial and Republic forces, fearing that Revan's meddling would only bring untold destruction, united with Revan's light side spirit to defeat him and an army of fanatical Revanite followers on Yavin 4. Although Vitiate fed off the battle and escaped to the galaxy at large, the two Revans merged together in peace and died a final death.

 Over three millennia later, the Sith Lord Darth Bane discovered Revan's Sith Holocron and used its teachings to destroy the reigning Brotherhood of Darkness and as inspiration for the Rule of Two, paving the way for Darth Sidious. </span>

       <span>Revan was an extremely powerful Jedi Master and Dark Lord of the Sith who lived four thousand years before the Battle of Yavin. He is credited as being among the most important characters in the Star Wars expanded universe for his military accomplishments and battlefield achievements across the Mandalorian Wars, Jedi Civil War, the Great Galactic War, and beyond.

Early Years and Training

"Revan had many Masters, Zhar, Dorak, Master Kae before Kae left for the Wars. Toward the end of his training, he sought out many to learn techniques. It is said that he returned to his first Master at the end of his training, in order to learn how he might best leave the Order."
―Jedi Scholar Mical

Revan was believed to have been born 3,994 years before the Battle of Yavin somewhere in the Outer Rim Territories. He was taken to be a Jedi at an early age and was apprenticed to Kreia, who would eventually go on to become Darth Traya. She soon discovered his immense command of the Force and he quickly learned everything she had to offer. However, her teaching methods and content raised concern by fellow Jedi Masters. Revan went on to study under many others alongside his friend Alek, and mastered everything the other masters had to offer as well. He quickly became the Jedi Order's most promising pupil, much to the caution of the Jedi Council who sensed something deeper. In the end, he returned back to his first master, wishing for knowledge on how to best leave the Jedi Order.

Revan defies the Jedi Council.

However, the Mandalorian armies, led by Mandalore the Ultimate and Cassus Fett, soon began expanding their empire to more and more worlds. Eventually, they moved inward and began conquering some of the Outer Rim Territories and Hutt Space. Among the battles included the Battle of Cathar, in which Cassus Fett ordered the mass genocide that almost completely wiped out the Cathar population. Eventually the Senate ordered the Galactic Republic military, under Saul Karath, to intervene, causing skirmishes to erupt on numerous fronts. Revan began to call for Jedi intervention in the war, rallying fellow young Jedi to his cause under the banner of the "Jedi Crusaders" to end the threat. The Jedi Council, however, condoned Revan's actions, believing the Jedi should not get involved in the war.

The Mandalorian Wars

"The Mandalorian Wars were a series of massacres that masked another war, a war of conversion. Culminating in a final atrocity that no Jedi could walk away from… save one."
―Jedi Master Kreia

The Mandalorian Wars

"The Mandalorian Wars were a series of massacres that masked another war, a war of conversion. Culminating in a final atrocity that no Jedi could walk away from… save one."―Jedi Master Kreia

Revan and the Jedi Crusaders.

As the war between the Galactic Republic and the Mandalorian armada waged on, Revan and his Jedi Crusaders went to the planet of Cathar. There they experienced a Force Vision that showed them the atrocities committed by the Mandalorians. In outrage, Revan picked up a fallen Mandalorian mask, donned it, and swore that he would not remove it until the Mandalorians were defeated forever. Pressing the Jedi Council's hand, Revan's movement was sanctioned and jumped into space, saving the shipyards of Duro from complete Mandalorian destruction in 3,962 BBY. Following the battle, Revan was named Supreme Commander of the Galactic Republic's military. A master tactician, Revan began pushing back the Mandalorian armies alongside his right-hand man Malak, formerly known as Alek.

As the war waged on, Revan continued to sacrifice his morals for victory, drawing closer and closer to the dark side. However, the Mandalorians respected him for this, believing that he was worthy advisory and among the greatest military leaders in history. Eventually, Revan came across the world of Malachor V, where he discovered a treasure of Sith artifacts. Revan embraced the dark side willingly, believing that its power was needed for ultimate victory. After studying the teachings of the ancient Sith who came before him, he orchestrated a plot where he would lure the Mandalorians into a great battle above Malachor V, in which he would completely eradicate their armies and seduce his fleet with the terrible energies of the dark side. Revan kept his true plans a secret.

Later, on the moon of Dxun, a long battle waged between the Jedi, led by Revan and fellow companion Meetra Surik. Revan drew out the conflict and put his soldiers in harm's way, believing that the trials they would endure would make them more susceptible to the dark side and easier to corrupt. Following the victory, Revan continued his push, eventually reaching his goal world of Malachor V. There, he split his fleet into two, sending first an army led by Meetra Surik consisting of all of those not loyal to him. Then came his supporters, who turned the tide of the battle. In the chaos, Revan slew Mandalore the Ultimate in single combat, activated a super weapon that destroyed the surface of the planet along with all the remaining Mandalorians, and corrupted the surviving Jedi under his command.

The Second Sith War

"Three years ago, Revan and Malak returned at the head of a massive invasion fleet. Revan had assumed the title of Sith Lord; the hero had become a conqueror."
―Jedi Master Dorak
Following the victory, the galaxy hailed Revan and Malak as the saviors of the galaxy. However, none could have expected what Revan did next. First, he exiled Meetra Surik, now a shattered Jedi after close exposure to the destruction Malachor V, back to the Jedi Council to show them the hypocrisy of their teachings. Then, his fleet parted into the Unknown Regions. Before Mandalore the Ultimate's death, the Mandalorian had revealed that it had not been his choice to go to war with the galaxy, and rather a Sith came to him with a prophecy. Revan and Malak searched for this Sith, coming across numerous worlds before finding the new Sith Empire's hidden capital of Dromund Kaas. There they learned the existence of a powerful Sith Emperor named Vitiate who planned on invading the galaxy.

Darth Revan and Darth Malak.

Revan and Malak confronted Vitiate in his throne room. However, Vitiate had been informed ahead of time of the Jedi's plot, and he quickly dominated them with his power. He turned them into servants of his will, christened them as Darth Revan and Darth Malak, and sent them back out to be the vanguard of his fleet and find an ancient factory called the Star Forge. Revan and Malak's willpower was greater than he anticipated, however, and they quickly broke free of his control. They found the Star Forge and used it to create a massive army of warships to invade the Galactic Republic on their own wishes. They planned on conquering the galaxy so that they could unify it to prepare it against Vitiate's armies.

Revan and Malak, with a new fleet and millions of fallen Jedi behind them, suddenly reappeared to the galaxy in 3,958 BBY, forcing the galaxy into the Jedi Civil War. Revan established a Sith Academy on Korriban to train hopeful recruits, strengthening his army. Due to Revan's familiarity with the enemy's tactics, and the fact that countless worlds joined his cause without a fight due to his actions in the Mandalorian Wars, the Jedi and the Galactic Republic were immediately taken aback on the defensive and lost battle after battle. Revan additionally orchestrated the assassination of numerous political figures, including Yusanis of Echani, and planted his own men in their place. He also instituted a sect of deadly Sith Assassins that would capture and corrupt Jedi mindlessly to the dark side of the Force.

Darth Malak, however, soon began to have his own ambitions. He viewed Revan as weak and unfit to be the ruler of the Sith Empire. Tension soon escalated into a lightsaber duel where Revan cut off Malak's jaw, forcing him to wear a metal prosthetic jaw. Also realizing that if they did not act quickly all hope of recovery would be lost, the Jedi Council soon after lured Revan and Malak into a trap. Bastila Shan and a Jedi strike team infiltrated Revan's capital ship in effort to capture him. Seizing advantage of Revan's momentary distraction, Malak fired upon Revan's ship, nearly killing Revan. Bastila Shan, the only Jedi survivor, healed Revan's injuries and brought him back before the Jedi Council for judgment. With Revan believed dead, Darth Malak declared himself the undisputed Dark Lord of the Sith.

Knights of the Old Republic

"Savior, conqueror, hero, villain. You are all things Revan… and yet you are nothing. In the end you belong to neither the light nor the darkness. You will forever stand alone."―Sith Lord Darth Malak

After the capture of Darth Revan and his transfer back to the Jedi Council, the combined might of the masters used the Force to erase the former Dark Lord's memories. They knew Revan was the only one powerful enough to destroy Darth Malak and the Sith, and thus they planned on recreating him as a weapon to unleash against them. They trained his new identity as a Jedi Knight, forcing him to undergo trials on the hidden world of Dantooine. After successfully completing the task, the Jedi Council sent out Revan and Bastila Shan to discover the location of the Star Forge by finding Star Maps located across the galaxy. When all the maps were found, the location of the Star Forge would be revealed to them. Revan was originally unaware of the Jedi's scheme, not knowing he was formerly a Sith Lord. </span>
