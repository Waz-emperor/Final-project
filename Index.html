―Valkorion[src]
Prior to the Great Galactic War, the Emperor of the Sith Empire, Vitiate, started building up the Eternal Empire on Zakuul under the name Valkorion. He planned to use the Eternal Fleet to reshape the galaxy, the Sith Empire actually being used as a "side project", with the Eternal Empire being his actual plan. During his time on Zakuul, he married Senya, a Knight of Zakuul and raised twin sons, Thexan and Arcann. After Vitiate took all life on the planet Ziost, he retreated into Wild Space to the planet  Here, he sent his sons to war against both the Galactic Republic and Sith Empire, eventually pushing both factions to the brink of extintion. During one such encounter on a Sith planet, an attack didn't go as planned, which led to Arcann losing his arm and half his face. In the throne room of the Eternal Empire, the twins presented their spoils of war. Valkorion took note, then turned his back on his sons, which enraged Arcann. Powered by the Dark side, Arcann leaped at his father, but got pulled back by his brother. After a swift duel, Thexan was killed. Valkorion then approached his now only son, and asked him to come with him.
Arrival of the Outlander
After the defeat of the Revanites, a joint Imperial and Republic fleet, led by Darth Marr, entered Wild Space while investigating leads potentially linked to Vitiate. Valkorion quickly noticed, and sent out the entire Eternal Fleet to engage them. After a quick battle, Marr, and an individual would be later known as the Outlander, were captured. Arcann brought them in front of the Eternal Throne, where Marr recognized Valkorion as the former Vitiate. Valkorian released Marr from his restraints and offered him mercy if Marr would only kneel, which Marr flatly refused. He only managed to kill a few guards before Valkorion hit him with a blast of Force lightning, killing him. Valkorian made the same offer to the Outlander, promising that with their obedience he would share his power with them. If the Outlander accepts, Valkorion begins the process of sharing his power, but Arcann seemingly kills him. If the Outlander refuses, Arcann is seemingly about to execute the Outlander, but instead cuts them lose from their bonds so they can both attack Valkorion. Valkorion easily defeated his son, but was seemingly killed by the Outlander with their weapon which Arcann had returned. Either way, Arcann survived the confrontation and took the Eternal Throne for himself, ordering the Outlander, who is unconscious, to be imprisoned; frozen in Carbonite for assassinating the Emperor.

While suspended in carbonite, the Outlander was met by Valkorion, telling him that he had finally shed his physical body, and reached true immortality as a Force spirit. Valkorion also revealed that Zakuul would be the new superpower in the galaxy, with an army of force users who did not follow only the light or the darkside. He, however, recognized that this was a power that Arcann misused. The Outlander was told that he was dying, and was woken up by Lana Beniko. </span>

       <span>Revan—renowned as the Revanchist, reviled as Revan the Butcher, worshiped as the Revan, dreaded as the Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Revan, and praised as the Prodigal Knight—was a human male who played pivotal roles as both Jedi and Sith in the Mandalorian Wars, Jedi Civil War, and Great Galactic War.

Believed to have been born around 3994 BBY in the Outer Rim Territories, the child later known as Revan was found by the Jedi Order and apprenticed to the Jedi Master Kreia. The Padawan had an insatiable hunger for knowledge and soon became the Jedi's most promising pupil. Alongside his friend Malak, he became a Jedi Knight and a vocal and charismatic critic of the Order's inactivity in the ongoing Mandalorian Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. In defiance of the Jedi Council, the Knight took upon the name Revan and started the Revanchist movement to combat the Mandalorians as the Republic Military's Supreme Commander. Revan and his forces gradually pushed back the Mandalorians, saving countless worlds at the price of devastating moral compromises and the embrace of dark side practices. On Malachor V, Revan defeated the Mandalorian leader Mandalore the Ultimate in single-combat and ordered the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator superweapon, destroying both armies and the planet but winning the war in the process.

Revan and Malak, now hailed as the greatest of heroes, vanished into the Unknown Regions to investigate a mysterious Sith influence behind the war. They discovered a hidden Sith Empire and fell under the thrall of the Sith Emperor Vitiate. Vitiate directed the newly anointed Darth Revan and Darth Malak to find the mystical Star Forge to escalate plans of a galactic invasion, but the pair broke free from his mind control and used the Star Forge for themselves—creating their own Sith Empire and a fleet of warships. Intent on unifying the galaxy to destroy the lurking Sith menace, they returned to the galaxy as conquerors and battled the Jedi and the Republic in the resultant Jedi Civil War. Revan almost succeeded, but Malak usurped the throne and fired aboard his flagship during a Jedi ambush led by Bastila Shan. Revan nearly died, but Bastila healed him and took him before the surviving Jedi for judgment.

The Jedi Council used their powers to wipe Revan's mind and soon retrained him as a Jedi. Alongside Bastila and newfound companions, Revan was tasked to relocate the Star Forge—the heart of Darth Malak's Sith Empire. Across his journey, Revan picked up more allies and fell in love with Bastila, but they were eventually intercepted by Malak's flagship. Malak revealed to Revan his true identity as the former Dark Lord, then captured and corrupted Bastila to the dark side. Revan escaped and, in a last stand, led the remaining Republic fleet against the Star Forge, redeemed Bastila back to the light side, and killed Malak in battle, destroying the Sith Empire he created. Revan married Bastila and sank into obscurity until visions from his past led him to rediscover Vitiate's Sith Empire. Alongside his former protégé Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile, and the Sith Lord Scourge, Revan attempted to assassinate the Emperor. However, Scourge betrayed the pair, killing Meetra and helping Vitiate imprison Revan in stasis.

Revan waged telepathic war against the Emperor for three-hundred years, influencing him into stalling his Sith invasion at terrible cost to his own psyche. Revan eventually escaped captivity and took control of the Foundry space station to construct an army of extermination droids against the Empire, but he was foiled and killed by an Imperial strike team. However, with his mind splintered across centuries of torture, his darker half rejected death and resolved to destroy Vitiate. The Emperor's body had recently been destroyed in battle, but his spirit lingered, so Revan planned to resurrect him to a physical form to permanently destroy him. A coalition of Imperial and Republic forces, fearing that Revan's meddling would only bring untold destruction, united with Revan's light side spirit to defeat him and an army of fanatical Revanite followers on Yavin 4. Although Vitiate fed off the battle and escaped to the galaxy at large, the two Revans merged together in peace and died a final death.

Over three millennia later, the Sith Lord Darth Bane discovered Revan's Sith Holocron and used its teachings to destroy the reigning Brotherhood of Darkness and as inspiration for the Rule of Two, paving the way for Darth Sidious. </span>

Darth Nihilus was a Human male who reigned as a Dark Lord of the Sith during the era of strife following the Jedi Civil War. Before becoming the Dark Lord, he lost everything during the Galactic Republic's war against the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders. He survived the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator superweapon during the war's final battle at the planet of Malachor V, which surrounded the planet with a destructive spacial phenomenon known as a mass shadow that obliterated almost everything and everyone on and around the planet. Experiencing the shadow made Nihilus "hunger" for Force energy, and the affliction began to ravage his body. In his pain he became a wound in the Force and was found by a seeker of such things, the Sith Lord Darth Traya, who told him that she could teach him to feed his endless hunger. He accepted her offer of apprenticeship at the Trayus Academy on Malachor V, and, over time, he became one of three concurrent Dark Lords of the Sith.

Together, the three formed a triumvirate. The trio chose individual names for themselves, with Darth Nihilus becoming the Lord of Hunger. The apprentices grew in strength during their training and eventually became stronger than Traya and overpowered her. Sion beat up Traya, while Nihilus sapped her energy, before the two Sith exiled her and combined their powers to sever her ties to the Force. Thus, Lord Nihilus took Traya's place and became Sith Emperor and Dark Lord of the Sith.

Nihilus's affliction developed to the point where the Dark Lord was forced to call upon the Dark side of the Force to encase his spirit within his armor to stay alive. Sion and him then began the Dark Wars and the Jedi purge, causing the virtual extinction of the Jedi Order. Nihilus was also responsible for the devastation of the planet Katarr, killing and absorbing the Force energy of the Jedi at the conclave on Katarr, along with every other living thing on the world save one Miraluka woman named Visas Marr, whom he would take from the surface and make his Shadow Hand.

One year later, Nihilus sensed a growing presence in the Force, and sent Marr to investigate and destroy it. That presence was a female Jedi, Meetra Surik, also known as the Jedi Exile, who was on a quest to find the remaining Jedi Masters who had survived the Purge. When Marr attempted to assassinate the woman, Surik defeated her and convinced her to turn to the light side of the Force in the process. Although Nihilus returned to lurking the fringes of known space, the Dark Lord was eventually tricked by Traya into initiating the Battle of Telos IV in an attempt to absorb a Jedi Academy that actually lacked any Force-sensitives aside from the headmistress. At Telos, Nihilus met a large fleet comprised of Republic and Mandalorian forces that distracted him while the Sith Lord's flagship, the Ravager, was secretly boarded by a small force consisting of Surik, Marr, Mandalore the Preserver, and his Mandalorians. The group eventually 'defeated' Nihilus made their escape and destroyed the Ravager. </span>
